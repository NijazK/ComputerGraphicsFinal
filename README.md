# Computer Graphics Final for CS 330
## Course Gaols/Outcomes
Students will create realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Students will also develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements.

# How Do I approach designing software?
Through many tests, design patterns, and color schematics, I have gained a fundamental idea of what it is like to be a graphics programmer. I have had the benefit of learning from a group of aspiring students and a supportive faculty of instructors that assisted with my learning. That said, I wanted to implement philosophy from different courses into such as software design patterns, coding best practices, and language syntax (OOP). These ideas allowed me to build reusable and sustainable code.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I wanted to create a robust 3d pyramid that camptured elements of trigonometry, geometry, and matrix algebra. In terms of OpenGL, the program uses vertex postions to represent position, color, textures, and coordinates. Using the extensive library of OpenGL, it is the programmers job to leverage these tools to design core patterns that ultimately lead to a fully-functioning software. With each milestone, the students were expected to add complexity to the project through logic.

# How can computer science helpm me in reaching my goals?
Learning about computational graphics using OpenGl has allowed me to gain skills for applications to game programming or website building with WebGL. If I ever pursue a career in these sectors, I know that I possess a certain level of functionality due to my exposure in CS 330.
